This README file is to explain the work I did on the technical project emailed to me after my interview.

I have never used Visual Studio before, much less Visual Studio 2019. 

The FIRST PART was the "Multiple Choice Grading Aassignment.
  I did my best with Visual Studio to make the Display Box. I assumed Window frames was the way to go.
  I was able to recreate the Grading Program Box witht he answer key and the student name/grades. 
  
  SEE: https://github.com/jgotcher2/ABIS/blob/master/Program.cs         (The grading code)
  SEE: https://github.com/jgotcher2/ABIS/blob/master/ListBox.png       (Screenshot of the Message Frame)
  
  Note that the code calculating the averages and letter grades and the frame are not connected.
  I simply don't know yet how to connect the two in visual studio.
  
The SECOND PART of the assignment was familiar by ways of working with bootstrap and manipulating the html.
I did make a bootstrap page.

Google Maps API
I got my Google API key: AIzaSyCCUlKj2_IRMogh803DQ6fhtXXXXXXXXXX (Just got an email from Google saying to hide this. Rookie mistake.)

I found the documentation from Google Developers website to run a "GoogleMap Control" through Visual Studio.
  But honestly, I don't know whow it all connects. But I uploaded what I was going to use anyways.
  
  SEE: https://github.com/jgotcher2/ABIS/blob/master/GoogleMapMarkup.html
  SEE: https://github.com/jgotcher2/ABIS/blob/master/Googlemaps.cs
  
For 3) and 4) on the second part, I did not do it becasue I needed functioning code for the bootstrap maps section. 

MY FINAL NOTE: I enjoyed doing this. I have not coded like this since May when I graduated with my CS degree.
I have been focused on RPA development using UiPath and Automation Anywhere platforms which lack the need for real development at the source code level.
I know I'm green when it comes to programming and the development field in general, but I learn fast and enjoy the work. 
I truly hope I have the opportunity to talk to you guys (and girls) further about how I can join your team.

Thank you for your Time!

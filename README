This README file is to explain the work I did on the technical project emailed to me after my interview.

I have never used Visual Studio before, much less Visual Studio 2019. 

The FIRST PART was the "Multiple Choice Grading Aassignment.
  I did my best with Visual Studio to make the Display Box. I assumed Window frames was the way to go.
  I was able to recreate the Grading Program Box witht he answer key and the student name/grades. 
  
  SEE: github.com/jgotcher2/ABIS/blob/master/Program.cs         (The grading code)
  SEE: github.com/jgotcher2/ABIS/blob/master/ListBox.png       (Screenshot of the Message Frame)
  
  Note that the code calculating the averages and letter grades and the frame are not connected.
  I simply don't know yet how to connect the two in visual studio.
  
The SECOND PART of the assignment was familiar by ways of working with bootstrap and manipulating the html.
I did make a bootstrap page.

This README file is to explain the work I did on the technical project emailed to me after my interview.

I have never used Visual Studio before, much less Visual Studio 2019. 

The FIRST PART was the "Multiple Choice Grading Aassignment.
  I did my best with Visual Studio to make the Display Box. I assumed Window frames was the way to go.
  I was able to recreate the Grading Program Box witht he answer key and the student name/grades.

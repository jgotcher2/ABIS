This README file is to explain the work I did on the technical project emailed to me after my interview.

I have never used Visual Studio before, much less Visual Studio 2019. 

The FIRST PART was the "Multiple Choice Grading Aassignment.
  I did my best with Visual Studio to make the Display Box. I assumed Window frames was the way to go.
  I was able to recreate the Grading Program Box witht he answer key and the student name/grades.

  SEE: https://github.com/jgotcher2/ABIS/blob/master/ListBox.png       (Screenshot of the Message Frame)
  
  Note that the code calculating the averages and letter grades and the frame are not connected.
  I simply don't know yet how to connect the two in visual studio.
  
The SECOND PART of the assignment was familiar by ways of working with bootstrap and manipulating the html.
I did make a bootstrap page.

Google Maps API
I got my Google API key: AIzaSyCCUlKj2_IRMogh803DQ6fhtXXXXXXXXXX (Just got an email from Google saying to hide this. Rookie mistake.)

I found the documentation from Google Developers website to run a "GoogleMap Control" through Visual Studio.
  But honestly, I don't know whow it all connects. But I uploaded what I was going to use anyways.
